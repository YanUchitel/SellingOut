  <p class="product-description">
    The Nintendo DS is a dual-screen handheld game console developed and
    released by Nintendo. The device went on sale in North America on November
    21, 2004. The DS, short for "Developers' System" or "Dual Screen",
    introduced distinctive new features to handheld gaming: an LCD screen
    working in tandem with a touchscreen, a built-in microphone, and support for
    wireless connectivity. Both screens are encompassed within a clamshell
    design similar to the Game Boy Advance SP. The Nintendo DS also features the
    ability for multiple DS consoles to directly interact with each other over
    Wi-Fi within a short range without the need to connect to an existing
    wireless network. Alternatively, they could interact online using the
    now-discontinued Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection service. Prior to its release,
    the Nintendo DS was marketed as a "third pillar" in Nintendo's console
    lineup, meant to complement the Game Boy Advance and GameCube. However,
    backward compatibility with Game Boy Advance titles and strong sales
    ultimately established the new handheld console as the successor to the Game
    Boy series.
